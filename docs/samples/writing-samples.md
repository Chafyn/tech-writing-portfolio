## üñºÔ∏è Example 1 ‚Äî VLC Installation (Install Location Step)

**Original Instruction (Plain)**  

Click Install.

### 1. Bare-bones Technical  
(Just the action, no explanation)  

Click Browse... to change the install folder or click Install to continue.

---

### 2. User-Friendly  
(Adds context and manages expectations)  

The installer is ready to use the default location. To choose a different folder, click Browse.... When you're ready, click Install to begin copying files to your computer.

### 3. Concise, Polished (Portfolio-Ready)  
(Short, clear, and professional tone)  

Accept the default install location, or click Browse... to choose a new one. Then click Install to begin installation.

### Reflection  
I chose the **Concise, Polished version** for my portfolio because it best embodies the principles of effective technical communication: clarity, efficiency, and audience awareness.  

- **Clarity and Scannability:** Uses strong, active verbs (*Accept, Click*) and lays out two options clearly.  
- **Professional Tone:** Balanced ‚Äî not robotic, not wordy.  
- **Efficiency:** Explains the Browse option succinctly.  
- **Audience Awareness:** Assumes basic technical literacy but still provides guidance for less experienced users.
