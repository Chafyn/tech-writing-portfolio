# 🖋️ Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a selection of my **technical writing samples**.  
I’m building this portfolio as I transition from professional **translation** (German & Spanish → English) into **technical writing**.  

---

## 📂 What you’ll find here
- [🌐 DeepL — Getting Started](deepl-getting-started/README.md)  
  Basics of using DeepL web app (Quick Start, Glossary, Troubleshooting).  

- [🖋️ Trados Studio 2017 — Getting Started](trados-getting-started/README.md)  
  Mini-doc set for new translators (Quick Start, How-To, Troubleshooting, Help).  


Each document lives in its own folder with a `README.md` and, where helpful, screenshots.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This portfolio shows how I approach **clear, structured documentation**:
- Writing instructions in plain, concise English  
- Using consistent terminology (leveraging my translation background)  
- Organizing information for beginners as well as advanced users
