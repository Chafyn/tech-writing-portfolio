# 🖋️ Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a selection of my **technical writing samples**.  
I’m building this portfolio as I transition from professional **translation** (German & Spanish → English) into **technical writing**.  

---

## 📂 What you’ll find here
- **How-To Guides** — step-by-step instructions for common tasks  
- **Quick Starts** — short guides for first-time users  
- **Troubleshooting Docs** — common problems and their solutions  

Each document lives in its own folder with a `README.md` and, where helpful, screenshots.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This portfolio shows how I approach **clear, structured documentation**:
- Writing instructions in plain, concise English  
- Using consistent terminology (leveraging my translation background)  
- Organizing information for beginners as well as advanced users
