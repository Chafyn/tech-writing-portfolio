# ðŸ“˜ How-To: Create and Use a Glossary in DeepL (Web App)

Glossaries let you control how specific terms are translated, ensuring consistency.

## Who this is for
Translators who want to enforce preferred terminology in their DeepL translations.

## What you need
- A free DeepL account (login required)  
- DeepL web app in your browser  
- Source and target languages supported by glossaries  
  (e.g., English â†” German, English â†” French)

## Steps

1. **Log in to DeepL**  
   Go to [https://www.deepl.com/translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator) and sign in.

2. **Open glossary settings**  
   - In the top bar, click **Glossary**.  
   - Select **Create glossary**.

3. **Add a term pair**  
   - Enter the **source term** (e.g., *car*).  
   - Enter the **preferred translation** (e.g., *Automobil*).  
   - Click **Add**.

4. **Check your glossary**  
   Your glossary list now shows the new entry.  
   Free accounts allow up to 10 entries in one glossary.

5. **Use the glossary**  
   - Translate text as usual.  
   - When the source term appears, DeepL automatically applies your glossary translation.

## Result
Your translations now follow your glossary rules, improving consistency and control.

## If things go wrong
- **Glossary doesnâ€™t apply:** Make sure the source and target language pair supports glossaries.  
- **Canâ€™t add more entries:** Free plan allows only 10 entries. Delete one to add another.  
- **Glossary option not visible:** Ensure you are logged in with a registered DeepL account.
