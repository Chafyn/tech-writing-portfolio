# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting: DeepL (Web App)

Common problems when using the free DeepL translator in a browser, and how to solve them.

---

## 1) I canâ€™t log in
**Cause:** Wrong password or using Google/Apple login without linking it to a DeepL account.  
**Fix:**  
- Reset your password at [https://www.deepl.com/account/reset-password](https://www.deepl.com/account/reset-password).  
- If you usually log in with Google or Apple, make sure to click the matching button on the login screen.

## 2) My file wonâ€™t upload
**Cause:** DeepL free supports only **Word (.docx)** and **PowerPoint (.pptx)**.  
**Fix:**  
- Convert your file to `.docx` or `.pptx` before uploading.  
- For PDFs, use another tool to convert to Word first.

## 3) The file is too large
**Cause:** Free accounts have a size limit per document.  
**Fix:**  
- Split the document into smaller sections.  
- Translate each separately.  
- Or upgrade to a paid plan for higher limits.

## 4) Glossary doesnâ€™t apply
**Cause:** Glossaries work only for supported language pairs (e.g., ENâ€“DE, ENâ€“FR).  
**Fix:**  
- Check that your source/target pair supports glossaries.  
- Make sure youâ€™re logged in, since glossaries are linked to your account.  
- Free accounts allow only 10 entries â€” delete one if the glossary is full.

## 5) The translation is missing formatting
**Cause:** DeepL sometimes strips complex formatting.  
**Fix:**  
- Simplify the original file before uploading.  
- Reapply formatting manually after translation.
